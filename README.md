# App Telemetry Collector

This is a mock server and sample mock client implementation of the App Telemetry in Couchbase Server 8.0 and SDKs aligned to that release.
It was built to enable SDK developers to iterate on interface design and enable concurrent development across multiple clients and server at the same time.
